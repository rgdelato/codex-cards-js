That's what he is at step 2 of those examples, so at step 3 when Midori's middle ability is involved, it will not buff Cadet because at a that point, Cadet does have an ability (stealth from Behind the Ferns). Similarly if you get Midori -> Cadet -> Ferns or Cadet -> Midori -> Ferns, the Cadet will be a 4/4 before Ferns happens, so it will stay a 4/4 with no abilities. However, if you play in this order: Ferns -> Midori -> Cadet or Midori -> Ferns -> Cadet, then the cadet is arriving while both effects already exist. In these cases it is also a 4/4 with no abilities.",
